# Bulk Obfuscate PHP
If you often update your php froject and want to obfuscate your source code
You may be familiar with https://tools.kodigen.com/online-tools/php-obfuscator
But I'm too lazy to obfuscate every single file one by one :( 

**Step 1**
download the repo and run the command  ``pip install requirements.txt``

**Step 2**
copy all file or folder you want to obfuscate in the php folder

**Step 3**
run the command  ``python obfuscate.py``

**Step 4**
Thanks Me If This Helps ;)
